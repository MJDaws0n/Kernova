# Kernova
This doesnt work and was an old project I have just uploaded it so i can remove it from my pc. I may come back to it in the future but for now I dob't suggest using it. It's not what it says it is, it's just a test app.

## Build with
gcc main.c -o kernova.exe -Wall -O2 ; .\kernova.exe .\example.exe
